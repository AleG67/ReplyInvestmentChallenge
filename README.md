# ReplyInvestmentChallenge

In this repo you can find the code for my "toy" Machine Learning models developed in the context of the Reply Investment challenge.

This project is not meant to be realistic or useful for actual trading. It was simply developed as a coding exercise to apply some of the coding skills I was learning and tackle with some problems related to models storage, data colletion, etc....
See streamlit app for more details on the project.

In the **FunctionsINVCHA.py** file you can find the functions I've written for this project.

In the **ESG_preliminary** notebook you can find the preliminary analysis performed to screen the stocks.

In the **Model_example** notebook you can find an example on how the models work, using data for a specific stock.

In the **Model_Final_ouput** notebook you can see how all the functions are combined to apply the models to each stock and obtain predictions for the stocks direction for the next day using real time data.
